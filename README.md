# Liquidity Acceleration Token (LAT)

## Overview
 Liquidity Acceleration Token (LAT) is a Solana-based protocol designed to enhance Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool liquidity by dynamically rewarding traders and liquidity providers (LPs) based on execution speed, trading volume, and market activity. The protocol uses an epoch-based reward system to optimize token distribution, reduce slippage, and attract High-Frequency Trading (HFT) activity.
